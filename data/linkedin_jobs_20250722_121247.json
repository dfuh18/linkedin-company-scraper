    "description": "About You\n\nYou are a seasoned event marketing leader with deep experience managing trade shows and field events across EMEA. You thrive in complex, fast-moving environments, love solving problems, and excel at cross-functional collaboration. You are highly autonomous and thoughtful — someone who doesn't just ask questions, but does the work to find answers, evaluate options, and present decision-ready insights to leadership. You balance independent execution with strong judgment, knowing when to ask for input and when to confidently move forward.\n\nAbout Us\n\nConstructor is the next-generation platform for search and discovery in ecommerce, built to explicitly optimize for metrics like revenue, conversion rate, and profit. Our search engine is entirely invented in-house utilizing transformers and generative LLMs, and we use its core and personalization capabilities to power everything from search itself to recommendations to shopping agents. Engineering is by far our largest department, and we've built our proprietary engine to be the best on the market, having never lost an A/B test to a competitive technology. We're passionate about maintaining this and work on the bleeding edge of AI to do so.\n\nOut of necessity, our engine is built for extreme scale and powers over 1 billion queries every day across 150 languages and roughly 100 countries. It is used by some of the biggest ecommerce companies in the world like Sephora, Under Armour, and Petco.\n\nWe're a passionate team who love solving problems and want to make our customers' and coworkers' lives better. We value empathy, openness, curiosity, continuous improvement, and are excited by metrics that matter.
